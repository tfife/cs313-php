            <div class="medTextbox">One of my favorite things about myself is my propensity for creativity. Ever since I was a little kid, I loved writing and wanted to be an author. I liked drawing and painting and wanted to be an artist. As I got older, I thought I might want to be an architect or an interior designer.</div>

            <div class="medTextbox">Sometimes I try new things. When I was in the Young Women's organization, I tried my hand at painting. This January, I tried crocheting for the first time. Both of these were successes. Sometimes, the things I try don't turn out as well, but I usually don't save pictures of the flops ;)</div>

            <div class="medTextbox">Something I've been doing for about eight years now is cake decorating. While I was <em>okay</em> at it from the beginning, it was amazing to look back to the beginning after a few years and to see how far I'd come. I still like to learn new techniques and even make up some of my own, like the ducks I piped onto this cake.</div>

            <div class="medTextbox">When I changed my major from English to Software Engineering, my only experience with programming was a one-credit Python class for non-majors. I was brand new to the world of computers, which is <em>still</em> a little overwhelming. But I love programming because it's a great way to be creative while also getting to think analytically and (hopefully) make a little bit of money. :)</div>
