            <div class="medTextbox">One of my favorite things about myself is my propensity for creativity. Ever since I was a little kid, I loved writing and wanted to be an author. I liked drawing and painting and wanted to be an artist. As I got older, I thought I might want to be an architect or an interior designer.</div>

            <div class="medTextbox">Sometimes I try new things. When I was in the Young Women's organization, I tried my hand at painting. This January, I tried crocheting for the first time. Both of these were successes. Sometimes, the things I try don't turn out as well, but I usually don't save pictures of the flops ;)</div>

            <div class="medTextbox">Something I've been doing for about eight years now is cake decorating. While I was <em>okay</em> at it from the beginning, it was amazing to look back to the beginning after a few years and to see how far I'd come. I still like to learn new techniques and even make up some of my own, like the ducks I piped onto this cake.</div>

            <div class="medTextbox">One <em>new</em> thing I started about three years ago is computer programming. After a single one-credit Python class for non-majors, I changed my major from English to Software Engineering. It was a totally new world, and I've never stopped feeling overwhelmed, but I know that with practice, I'll be able to look back and see how far I've come. Programming is just another way to express my creativity, while at the same time thinking analytically and (hopefully) making some money. :)</div>
